Data Project: Build a simple Data Dashboard

1) Choose a dataset

    a) The dataset should have at least 1000 rows, and at least 5 columns - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/doaaalsenani/usa-cers-dataset

    b) The dataset should have both numerical and categorical data - Done

    c) If you cannot find a dataset you like, one will be provided for you - n/a

2) Clean the Data

    a) Import your chosen dataset into a Jupyter Notebook - Done

    b) Clean out any missing data - Done

    c) Replace or remove any incorrect data - Done

    d) Separate data into any number of appropriate data frames (groupbys, logical separations, categorical separations, etc.) - Done

    

3)  Examine the Data

    a) Find the maximum, minimum, and average of all numerical data 

b) Group the data on categorical data and extract aggregate maximum, minimum and average values

c) Add calculated columns to your dataframes to demonstrate important relationships between other columns.

d) Merge any related data onto your main dataframes

e) Display any comparative data in a display dataframe

4) Interpret the Data

What does all of this mean?

Express in human language what these values represent

5) Extensions:

Plot the data!

Using Pandas built in plotting tool, or use MatPlotLib or Seaborn

Write the clean data to a file

        i)  This file can be csv or json

Write the file to an SQL DB of your choice    

Normalize the data before writing it.
